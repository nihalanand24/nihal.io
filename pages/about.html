                Hi! I'm Nihal Anand and I am a front-end web developer with a strong passion for mild coffee. 
            </p>
            <p>
                With a strong foundation in core front-end languages such as HTML and CSS, as well as fundamental programming languages such as C and Python, I have further honed my advanced front-end development skills by graduating from the Juno College Web Development Bootcamp in April 2021. I have proven expertise in advanced Javascript frameworks and building React apps and this is demonstrated through my projects featured on the <a href="/work">Work</a> page. Going above and beyond the required course material has led me to gain invaluable experience in creating innovative solutions even when pre-written libraries are not available. 
            </p>
            <p>
                With a former career in corporate photography and videography, using my technical skills to help others bring their creative visions to life is a passion of mine and something I have been doing for many years. I hope to continue this endeavour and am excited to contribute to any team environment I join!
