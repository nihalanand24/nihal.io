                Hi! I'm Nihal, a front-end web developer with a strong passion for mild coffee. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Bringing creative vision to life is my driving force. I have a firm foundation in core front-end languages, as well as fundamental programming concepts. I have built proven expertise in advanced Javascript frameworks and building React apps (see <a href="/work">Work</a>). I further honed my skills at the Juno College Web Development Bootcamp, graduating in April 2021. Going above and beyond the required course material, I gained invaluable experience in creating innovative solutions without the aid of pre-written libraries.
            </p>
            <p>
                With a double major in English and Media Studies from the University of Toronto and years of experience in corporate photography and videography, I have always helped others bring alive their creative vision through my communication and technical skills. I hope to continue on this exciting journey!
            </p>
            <p>
                And when Iâ€™m not occupying the digital realm, you might find me ensconced in my analog retreat dabbling in film photography, or baking sourdough bread while listening to jazz classics on vinyl.
