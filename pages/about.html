                Hi! I'm Nihal, a front-end web developer with a strong passion for mild coffee. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Bringing creative vision to life is my driving force. I have a firm foundation in core front-end languages such as HTML and CSS, as well as fundamental programming languages such as C and Python. I have built proven expertise in advanced Javascript frameworks and building React apps (see <a href="/work">Work</a>). I further honed my skills at the Juno College Web Development Bootcamp, graduating in April 2021. Going above and beyond the required course material, I gained invaluable experience in creating innovative solutions without the aid of pre-written libraries.
            </p>
            <p>
                With a former career in corporate photography and videography, using my technical skills to help others bring alive their creative vision is a passion I have been pursuing for years. I hope to continue on this exciting journey!
            </p>
            <p>
                And when Iâ€™m not in my digital cocoon, you might find me baking sourdough bread or dabbling in analog photography while listening to classics on vinyl.
